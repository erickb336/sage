// The sage hook. Claude Code sends one JSON event on stdin; the hook answers with one JSON object on stdout, or nothing.
//   - "sage mode" makes the session the user's chief of staff (agents/chief-of-staff.md) until "sage mode off". A
//     session that starts as the sage:chief-of-staff agent is in sage mode from its first event. Only the user's own
//     words switch a mode on, or sage mode off: never an agent's report, a task notification or another session's
//     message (promptOf). When the hook cannot read the frames of a prompt, nothing in it switches a mode on (fail
//     closed). An autopilot off counts in more text: in the owner's text, in a message the owner sends while Claude
//     works, and in a frame on a line that starts with the off-phrase. Such a message never switches a mode on.
//   - In sage mode it holds the rules that prompts alone did not hold in Orchestrator (docs/design/sage-mode.html,
//     "Rules"): the chief never edits files, every brief has all its fields, at most cap.<project> (default
//     max_agents) sage agents run at once for a project and cap_total across all projects, nobody force-pushes or pushes to main, and a merge needs autopilot on, the checked head SHA and the clean
//     cycles that the ledger records for it (the merge check), and an agent never merges. The merge rule and the push rule are allow-lists: a
//     command that names a merge or runs a push is refused unless it is exactly the merge form or the push form, or the
//     merge text stands only in a harmless command's text. Both rules apply to every command tool (SHELL_TOOLS: Bash,
//     Monitor, PowerShell, mcp__terminal__*), not only Bash. One case asks the user instead of a refusal: the chief's
//     first creation of main or master on GitHub, in one literal gh api form (FIRST_FORM), checked on GitHub only
//     (firstUpload, firstCreation).
//   - Only main starts leads (3 per project); only leads start their permitted children (3 each), inside the project cap.
//   - A sage agent may finish only with the full report of the sage:report skill.
//   - Only the chief writes the logbook, in any mode (agentWriteProblem): an agent runs the state tool only as one plain
//     read command, never the PR script, never a command outside the sandbox, never writes under the sage root with a
//     file tool (canonical paths), and never runs a shell write near the logbook (deny by default). Shell text cannot be
//     read completely: the sandbox (T80) is the full guard for shell writes.
//   - Only sage.mjs changes the logbook (chiefProblem): the chief's own file tools and shell writes never change it.
//   - An agent (a sage agent, or any subagent in sage mode; never the chief) never runs git stash, and never runs a
//     program that lists or signals processes unless that program is a fake in the temp folder (agentProblem).
// SAGE_HOOKS=off turns it off. The hook never breaks a session: on an error it answers nothing, but it refuses a merge,
// a push, every file change and command of an agent, and a chief's shell write that names a logbook file.

 * the owner's message to them. A frame closes only with a close of its own kind. Another session's message closes with
 * the note that Claude Code puts after it, so the note is part of the frame.
 * The hook counts the frames on the prompt as Claude Code sent it.
 *   - The owner's message that Claude Code queues while it works (queuedText) comes in a system reminder. It counts only
 *     as a whole system reminder, with Claude Code's note, outside every other frame and with no frame mark in it. The
 *     queued shape inside another frame is that frame's text. An agent can write a whole queued shape at the end of a
 *     bare system reminder, and the hook cannot tell it from a real one. So a queued message counts only for an
 *     autopilot off, never for an on: the owner sends an on again when Claude is idle.
 *   - text: the text before the first frame and after the last close. An agent cannot write there, also when it
 *     writes a close in its report, because the real close comes after it. It can switch a mode on.
 *   - outside: all the text outside the frames, also between two frames, with the queued messages. It counts only for
 *     an autopilot off (the broad off rule).
 *   - owner: false when the hook cannot read the frames (fail closed): a kind with more opens than closes or more
 *     closes than opens, or a frame's marker in the text. Then nothing in the prompt switches a mode on.
